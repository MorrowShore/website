Drawpile 2.1 will now prompt you to update to 2.2. If you already updated to 2.2 manually, you don't need to do anything.

You can find a summary of what changed [on this page explaining how to update](https://docs.drawpile.net/help/common/update2x1).

The updater didn't prompt before because we were still waiting for Microsoft's SmartScreen to stop flagging the program, which seems to have mostly happened by now. There's unfortunately no way around this other than either waiting for it to happen or paying them protection money for it.

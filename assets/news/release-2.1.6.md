Version 2.1.6 is now out. For Windows users, this release fixes the tablet problems
that appeared in the previous 2.1.5 version.

Bugs fixed in this release:

 * Fixed tablet support in the Windows build
 * Fixed that the chat box would autoscroll when not scrolled to the bottom
 * Fixed session settings shortcut clash with the fullscreen shortcut (F11) by removing the default shortcut for session settings
 * Fixed lines being drawn across the canvas if session reset occurs while midstroke

Features and other changes:

 * Added Night Mode (Windows and Linux only at the moment, support for macOS coming later)
 * Session permissions can now be saved as presets
 * New shortcut: Tab now hides or shows toolbars and docks
 * Added an option to share the same color across all tool slots
 * Session can now be reset to an image loaded from file
 * Scrollbars are now hidden in fullscreen mode
 * Added "pick color from layer" brush mode
 * Enabled smooth canvas scaling at certain zoom levels (1-200% or 1-800% when rotated)

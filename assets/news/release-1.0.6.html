Drawpile 1.0.6 is now out!

This release introduces a couple of new features to help session moderation,
as well as a few bugfixes.

The new features are:

 * Server: session expiration time now works as an idle timeout
 * Server: added /opword command (see the [session moderation tips](/help/mod-tips/) page for details)
 * Name of the user who created an annotation is now displayed next to the text edit box
 * Server now sends log messages for every operator command
 * Docks can now be locked in place

Bug fixes and other changes:

 * Fill and paste commands are now correctly enabled/disabled when user's operator status changes
 * Fixed freeform selection fill blending mode
 * Cut and fill operations now only work on selections to make it less easy to accidentally erase whole layers
 * User cursor is now shown for paste and fill operations
 * Server: kicked users are now immediately removed from the session, without waiting for the connection to gracefully terminate.

Two new releases today: stable branch version 1.0.4 and the
first beta of the new 2.0 series.

Changes in **version 1.0.4** are:

 * Username length is now limited to 22 characters
 * Correct error message is now shown if the server is full
 * An error message is shown if the user's IP address has been banned
 * Cut&paste and fill operations can now be limited to session owners
 * User list can be included in session announcement
 * Undo override can now be used while session is locked

Version 1.0.4 is mostly compatible with previous versions, the exception
being the cut&paste restriction. In older versions, the tools will not
be disabled in the user interface, but will just fail to work.

**Version 2.0.0 beta 1** is the first release of the 2.0 branch. It is not
compatible with 1.0 branch versions and might not be compatible with the
final 2.0.0 version.

Version 2.0.0 mostly lays groundwork for future development, but does have
some new features visible to the end user. These include:

 * True live previews for line, rectangle and ellipse tools
 * New simplified session playback dialog
 * Session resetting

Behind the scenes, the code has been cleaned up and the separation between the
user interface and engine code improved. This will make it possible to implement
alternative UIs (mobile/tablet interface, for example) that share the same
paint engine and networking code.

Another important change is an update to the network protocol. The redesigned
protocol better defines the roles of the client and the server and makes
server implementation simpler. A new standalone server designed
especially for running public servers is already in the works. Another benefit is that
the protocol allows the server to be largely version-agnostic. In contrast, the
current server is is very tightly coupled to the client version, so changing or adding
certain features (such as new tool types) is impossible without breaking compatibility.

Now, this being the first beta release, expect bugs! Version 2.0 is not compatible
with 1.x versions, and cannot be used on the drawpile.net public server.
Once 2.0 stabilizes enough to become the new default,
the public server will be switched over to it.
There are also no protocol stability promises until the final 2.0 release.

The following features are missing from this release, but will be restored later:

 * Session hibernation
 * Server web-admin UI
 * Session administration via IRC style commands

To get 2.0 stabilized quickly, your help is needed!
If you find a bug or a feature that is missing or not working anymore,

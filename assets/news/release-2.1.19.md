Hot on the heels of the previous release is version 2.1.19. Among other improvements, this release fixes a performance regression that got into the last version.

Changes include:

 * Fixed performance regression (noticeable especially when using the selection tool on large boards)
 * Fixed crash when adding a new input preset
 * On Windows, the "fusion" widget style is now always used for consistency. (Previously, fusion style was used only with the dark mode.)
 * Added a canvas rotation widget to the status bar.
 * Fixed that invalid canvas resize commands could crash the application
 * Unfinished indirect strokes now get exported properly
 * Fixed graphical corruption in navigator at the start of a session.

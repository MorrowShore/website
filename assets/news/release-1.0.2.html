Drawpile 1.0.2 is out!

This is another bug fix release that is fully compatible with version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 (and future 1.x releases too.)

Changes in this version are:

 * New feature: added option to split serverside recordings at each snapshot
 * The "/force_snapshot" command is now available outside debug mode
 * Fixed selection content stretching if selection was partially outside the canvas
 * Improved URL detection in chat
 * Simplified history conflict resolution (fixes some lagging issues)
 * Hidden layers are no longer saved in a flattened image
 * Fixed tablet pressure glitch at the beginning of a stroke
 * Faster loading of OpenRaster images with a solid background layer

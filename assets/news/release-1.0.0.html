Drawpile 1.0.0 is here!

After about 3 years of development (or 8 if you count the hiatus), Drawpile is
finally out of Beta and the first stable release is ready!

The most important changes in this version are:

 * Fixed UI lockup and disconnection when joining a session
 * New "behind" and "color erase" blending modes
 * Gestures now work on touchscreens
 * Automatic port forwarding setup with UPnP
 * Improvements to the selection tool
 * Lots of bugs fixed, including one that could crash the application

Version 1.0 is the beginning of the first stable branch: there will be
no more protocol changes until version 2.0.  All 1.x version will be fully interoperable.

This release marks the completion of the original roadmap, and then some.
In the past two years of development Drawpile gained support for layers,
the OpenRaster file format, multiuser undo and session recording,
just to name a few features. Even some features originally planned for
version 2.0 or later, such as the watercolor brush, the lag-free
"retroactively consistent" synchronization method, public session listings
and animation export were added.

With 1.0 now out, does this mean Drawpile is now all done and bug free?
Far from it. Development of version 2.0 will start next, with lots of interesting
new features planned. Since 2.0 will be a fairly major reworking of the
application's internals, the 1.X branch will continue to get bug fix
releases until 2.0 is finished.

### Roadmap for 2.0 and beyond

So, what's planned for the 2.x series?

**[Redesigned protocol]**: the new protocol will make it possible
to implement a dedicated server that support a variety of client versions
and, meaning it will be possible to add new features (e.g. new brushes
and tools) without having to update the server as well.
The new protocol better separates the responsibilities of
the client and server, which will greatly simplify the server code.

**New dedicated server**: a server written from scratch to take
advantage of the new possibilities offered by the redesigned protocol.
This will be a separate project designed primarily for long running public servers.

The bundled dedicated server will still be supported, since
it is basically just a wrapper around the built-in server with some extra
features. Some of those features will probably be moved to the
new server, though.

**[Encrypted sessions]**: Drawpile can use TLS to protect the
connection to the server, but does not offer true end-to-end security.
In the new protocol, it will be possible to encrypt the session content itself,
so that even the server cannot snoop in!

**Tablet PC optimized UI**: a separate simplified UI designed to be
usable with pen and touch input only. Possibly also for Android tablets.
This will be an additional UI to complement the traditional desktop
application and will not replace it. (Although the desktop UI will
be freshened up a bit too.)

On a more technical note, the new tablet UI will be written in QML,
which means the old QGraphicsView based canvas must be ported to Qt Quick.
Since maintaining both Qt Quick and QGraphicsView versions would
be a chore and a surefire way to introduce annoying inconsistencies, the
Qt Quick based canvas will be adopted on the desktop side as well.

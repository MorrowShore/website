There is now a new section on the website: the Gallery.

The gallery is a place for Drawpile users to showcase their work and find new groups to join. The gallery section is still a work in progress; there are many planned features that are not yet ready, but the basics work: you can upload pictures, leave comments and create and join groups.

Note that the gallery is still an experimental feature, so please keep backups of everything you upload.

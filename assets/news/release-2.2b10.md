Drawpile 2.2 beta 10 is out, **[download it here.](/download/)**

This is a hotfix for [beta 9](/news/release-2.2b9/). It would lock up on startup in some cases.

This version is a release candidate. That means no new features are expected to be added to it until the final release, but bugfixes and translations may.

That means if you have any bugs to report or stuff that's still missing for you to work properly, now is the time to report them so that they can get handled before Drawpile comes out of beta! Have a look at [the help page](/help/) on how to report things.

## Changes in this Release

Most of the interesting changes are [in the news post for beta 9](/news/release-2.2b9/)!

This release represents less than a day of development. It contains only bugfixes and translations.

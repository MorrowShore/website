Version 2.0.11 is now out. This is a minor bugfix release.

Changes in this version are:

 * Server: fixed OP status auto-restoration for users who used the "become operator" feature
 * Server AppImage: updated libmicrohttpd to version 0.9.59
 * Fixed a crash caused by dragging&dropping a layer that was deleted during the drag operation
 * Fixed unsetting shortcuts which have a default value
 * Changed default "session settings" shortcut to F9, to avoid collision with the default (Windows) fullscreen shortcut F11
 * Added a nicer set of presets for the brush palette
 * Sending USR1 signal to drawpile-srv now restarts the internal web-admin server
 * Updated Chinese translation

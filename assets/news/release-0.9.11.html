Due to a serious bug discovered in the previous release, here is one more release
before 1.0.

Bugs fixed in this release are:

 * Freeform selections disappearing when dragged
 * Incorrect pixel compositing in video exports (especially noticable with eraser strokes)
 * Random crashes when animation export dialog is closed

There was also time to add one extra feature: animated GIF export!
Both animations and session recordings can be exported as GIFs.

In other news, I will be setting up a public Drawpile server in a few weeks. In addition to helping
those having firewall trouble to host sessions, it will also serve as a testbench for the server itself
to see how it performs under load.

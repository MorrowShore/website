Drawpile 1.0.5 is now out!

This is a minor release that fixes a couple of bugs. Changes in this version are:

 * Fixed loading of custom palettes on OSX (bug introduced in version 1.0.4)
 * Fixed untrusted certificate error on OSX
 * Improved performance when joining a session (fixed window title change spamming on every change event)
 * Fixed restoration of eraser hard edge mode when switching tools

The most important change in this release is the performance fix. If joining sessions is causing Drawpile
to lock up for you, this release may help with that.
